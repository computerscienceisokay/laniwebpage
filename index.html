<p>Governments take down chunks 
of forests for human benefits/more buildings, land, companies, etc. It 
hurts our environment and living things in the forest such as plants, organisms, 
and animals in the forest. Most's endangered of deforestation are 
the rainforests. Rainforests are extremely important, they absorb carbon dioxide, 
and help us by cleaning the air. If deforestation goes on, a variety of health issues 
could occur more often. Carbon dioxide could cause: headaches, dizziness, difficulty breathing, 
sweating, tiredness etc.</p>
