<h1> 🐈‍ Rescue story 🐈‍
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 0.6em ">My mom and me were going to visit my grandma. Suddenly we heard a loud meow seem to be coming 
from the bushes. My mom was trying to see if the meowing was actually comeing from the bushes, but then I told my mom "what
if somebody was trying to pretend to meow so when we go investigate they'll kidnapp us." So after she drive behind the bush
to make sure it wasn't somebody, she parked the car, and tried to hear closely to where is this loud meow was coming from, 
finally we figured out where the sound was coming from. The meowing was coming from inside of one of the residents car, so
one of the neighbors offered to find out who's car was it. After she found the owner, the owner poped up the hood and a 
kitten jumped out of the car, we decided to chase it to check if it's condition was okay. We manage to catch the kitten
and at that very moment we decided to bring it home with us.</p>
